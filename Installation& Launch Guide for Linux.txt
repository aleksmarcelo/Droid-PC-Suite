How to install and run on Linux?

(1) Install Dependencies first using Dependencies_Installer_for_Linux.sh
(2) Run application using Launcher_for_Linux.sh

NOTE: Dependencies_Installer_for_Linux.sh currently only supports linux distros such as Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint etc. Actually it supports all linux distros which use APT package manager. You need to modify Dependencies_Installer_for_Linux.sh to install on Distros like Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Arch Linux, etc.
